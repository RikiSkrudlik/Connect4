# Connect4
This is the connect4 game with the minimax algorithm coded in C.

This game uses en 8x8 board nad has 2 gamemodes, (1vPC) or (1v1), against the PC you can choose 3 types of difficulty (Easy-Medium-Hard).
The computer uses the Minimax recursive algorithm to choose for the better play, depending on which difficulty you chose, the minimax 
will create more or less levels and nodes. (More difficulty = more levels). 
I have to say the hard mode is pretty difficult so have a good time trying to win!
